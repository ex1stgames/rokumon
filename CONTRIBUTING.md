# How to contribute

This project is still pretty much a work in progress and there are many things to do, so I would be quite happy to get pull requests!

If you want to play with Rust/WebAssembly/React/JavaScript/WebWorkers/CSS and want to help with the project, you can take a look at the [issues list](https://github.com/sphynx/rokumon/issues). I've marked some of the easy ones with "good first issue" tag, they may be a reasonable starting point.

Instructions about how to build and run the project are in the README. Please create a Github issue, if you have any questions or difficulties with building or running it.
